ðŸ”¹ About Me:
I am a PhD Researcher specializing in AI-driven fracture mechanics simulations and computational mechanics. My research focuses on leveraging deep learning, finite element modeling (FEM), and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to accelerate fracture propagation simulations. I work extensively with numerical methods, high-performance computing (HPC), and surrogate modeling to improve efficiency in structural failure prediction.

ðŸ”¹ Research Interests:
â€¢ Artificial Intelligence for Fracture Mechanics (Deep Learning, PINNs, Surrogate Models)
â€¢ Computational Mechanics & Finite Element Methods (FEM, MUMPS, PETSc)
â€¢ Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance & Structural Health Monitoring
â€¢ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) & Bayesian Optimization for Materials Science
â€¢ High-Performance Computing (HPC) & Parallel Processing for Engineering AI
â€¢ AI Applications in Aerospace, Automotive, and Advanced Materials

ðŸ”¹ Publications & Collaborations:
I am actively involved in publishing high-impact research in AI for computational mechanics, contributing to open-source numerical simulation frameworks, and collaborating on machine learning-driven damage classification in composites.
